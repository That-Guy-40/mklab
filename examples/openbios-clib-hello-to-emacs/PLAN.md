# PLAN — openbios-clib-hello-to-emacs

**Status: ALL phases COMPLETE and green on BOTH arches — the ladder is done.**
`hello`, `memtest`, `edit`, and `emacs` all run as IEEE 1275 client programs on
stock `qemu-system-ppc` *and* on a revived OpenBIOS-x86 (six firmware repairs,
POC-4); **eight green smoke verdicts** (four rungs × two arches). Phase 4's
finale — a MicroEMACS-style multi-line editor — landed on top of the POC-5
foundation (POC-6).
Follow-on to [`../openbios-the-rival-that-shipped/`](../openbios-the-rival-that-shipped/README.md).
Same house style, same spike→POC→assemble lifecycle. Where the rival lab taught
**Forth/FCode** extension (words loaded *into* the interpreter), this lab teaches
the *other* IEEE 1275 extension path: **client programs** — machine-code C
binaries the firmware `load`s and enters, which call *back* into firmware
through the client interface (§6.3.2). It reproduces Open Firmware's
[`clients/`](https://github.com/openbios/openfirmware/tree/master/clients)
directory (`hello`, `lib`, `memtest`, `emacs`) on the modern `openbios/openbios`
codebase.

## Thesis

`clients/lib` is a **C runtime library**, not a bag of Forth words: it lets a
plain C program run standalone on the bare machine, with the firmware callback
standing in for the operating system. OpenBIOS already ships the mechanism
(`utils/ofclient/`, and `of_client_interface()` — all 25 services — compiled
into every arch), so the question was never "can it?" but "where has it rotted?"
Answer, from the spikes: **the client interface is alive on ppc and a museum on
x86** — a deeper museum than even the *Linux*-boot path the rival lab revived,
because a client is a more general thing than a kernel.

## The two de-risking spikes (out-of-tree, agent-verified — see POC-1/POC-2)

| # | de-risks | outcome | POC |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | does the shipped client interface actually enter a C client? | **PASS (ppc)** — `hello` loaded from CD, `boot`, "Hello world!" over the CIF | [2](POC-2-PPC-HELLO.md) |
| B | what does x86 need? | **gap confirmed + root-caused** — a 3-fix revival; fix #1 (CIF-plant) written & builds | [PLAN §Phase 3] |

## Decisions (user-confirmed)

- **Name** `openbios-clib-hello-to-emacs` (names the ladder + the C library).
- **Both arches; x86 revival is the capstone.** ppc proves the mechanism early
  (its client entry-glue is already wired); the lab then *builds toward*
  completing the x86 client ABI as its climax.
- **Ladder:** `hello → clib → memtest → emacs` (a RAM-tester client, then a
  MicroEMACS port with its tutorial as data).
- Routing: joins `close-to-the-metal`; a `boot-and-crash` step is added once the
  x86 capstone lands (so the journey never advertises an unfinished lab).

## Phases

- **Phase 0 — build box + clib. ✅ DONE.** Lean cross-toolchain container
  (`Containerfile`); vendored `utils/ofclient` as the clib seed
  (`clib/of1275*`), grown with `clib.{c,h}` (`puts`/`put_udec`/`put_hex` on the
  firmware `write` service). `build-client.sh [ppc|x86] [program]`.
- **Phase 1 — ppc proves it. ✅ DONE (green).** `smoke-client.sh ppc`: stock
  `qemu-system-ppc` loads `hello-ppc` from a CD and answers `Hello world!` +
  the clib number formatting, all over the client interface. POC-2.
- **Phase 2 — memtest as a client. ✅ DONE (green).** `clib` grew a
  `claim`-backed allocator (`clib_claim`/`clib_release`) and a `/memory` `reg`
  walk (`clib_ram_bytes`); `clib/memtest.c` claims 4 MiB and runs
  address-uniqueness + four data fills + a walking-bit pass, reporting
  `memtest: PASS`. `smoke-client.sh ppc memtest`.
  [POC-3](POC-3-MEMTEST.md).
- **Phase 3 — the x86 revival capstone. ✅ DONE (green). POC-4.** All three
  clients — `hello`, `memtest`, `edit` — run on a revived OpenBIOS-x86, verified
  by `smoke-client.sh x86 {hello,memtest,edit}` on KVM. **Six** repairs, not the
  three scoped, all descending from one design decision: x86 relocates the
  firmware by *rebasing the GDT*, so firmware pointers are segment-relative and
  `virt_offset` scales with RAM size — and nobody ever taught the client path.
  1. `load-base` resolved past the end of RAM (reads returned zeros while the
     device reported full success) → computed at runtime.
  2. The launched client was never handed the callback (ppc plants it in `r5`).
  3. The ELF loader never declared `>ls.file-type`, so *both* arms of
     `arch_init_program`'s type test had been unreachable for years.
  4. The client was entered with **flat** segments. Fork: a trampoline + rewriting
     the dispatcher (every `pb->args[i]` may or may not be a pointer, per
     service), versus entering the client in the firmware's **`RELOC`** segments
     so nothing needs translating. Chose the latter; the client links at
     `0x20000`, inside a window that sizes itself with `virt_offset`.
  5. x86 had **no console device node** — `/chosen` stdin/stdout were both `0`,
     so every client `write()` went to ihandle 0 and vanished. Wrapped the
     console the arch already has in an `open`/`read`/`write` node.
  6. x86 bound no **`cif-claim`** → a bump allocator over the free window.
  All six: [`patches/01-x86-client-revival.patch`](patches/01-x86-client-revival.patch),
  applied by [`build-firmware-x86.sh`](build-firmware-x86.sh) on top of the rival
  lab's eight. POC-4 also **retracts an earlier misdiagnosis of this same
  phase** — "reaches none of the loaders" was an instrument artifact.
- **Phase 4 — the editor rung. ✅ DONE (green, both arches).** Two rungs:
  - **4a `edit` (POC-5).** `clib` grew its console half — `getch` (polls the
    non-blocking firmware `read`), `put_char`, `cls`, `gotoxy` (ANSI). `edit.c`
    is a tiny one-line editor driven headlessly: `smoke-client.sh {ppc,x86} edit`
    types `hellX`, Backspaces the `X`, adds `o`, Ctrl-X → `edit: wrote 5 chars:
    hello`. Proves the interactive foundation.
  - **4b `emacs` (POC-6, the finale).** `emacs.c` — a **MicroEMACS-style**
    multi-line screen editor on that same shim + `clib_claim`: a line-array
    buffer carved from one `claim` arena, the emacs keymap (`C-f/C-b/C-n/C-p`,
    `C-a/C-e`, `C-d`/Backspace, `C-k`, Enter=split, `C-x C-s`/`C-x C-c`),
    full-screen redraw with a reverse-video mode line, and the tutorial preloaded
    as data. Driven headlessly (`smoke-client.sh {ppc,x86} emacs`): type `MEOW`,
    Enter (a line **split** — the multi-line op `edit` can't do), `PURR`,
    `C-x C-c` → a plain buffer dump with `| MEOW` on its own line. *No new clib*
    — pure client code on rungs 3–4's foundation. A faithful reimplementation of
    the MicroEMACS core, **not** a line-for-line port of Lawrence's OS-coupled
    uEmacs (termios/files/signals/termcap have no meaning in a no-OS client).

- **Extension — load a client from a hard disk, not a CD. ✅ DONE (green, x86).
  POC-7.** The `load` path is medium-agnostic; the same `hello`/`emacs` boot off
  a hard disk at `/ide@0/disk@0` — **ext2** on the firmware as shipped
  (`smoke-client.sh x86 <prog> disk`) and **FAT** after `build-firmware-x86.sh`
  flips `CONFIG_FSYS_FAT=true` (`… <prog> disk-fat`). Helpers: `stage-disk.sh
  <prog> [ext2|fat]`, `run-client-qemu.sh … [disk|disk-fat]`. Three museum
  gotchas: **FAT off in the stock config** (a FAT image fails *silently* until
  the rebuild), modern `mke2fs` defaults break the **GRUB-0.97 ext2 driver**
  (needs `-b 1024 -I 128` + a stripped feature set), and the `$load` arg needs a
  **backslash** path (a `/` is eaten by the device-path parser). ppc disk is a
  future spike (its stock blob's fs set isn't ours to recompile).
  [POC-7](POC-7-DISK-BOOT.md).

## Justified deviations

- **No firmware build for the ppc track.** The ppc client is entered by the
  *stock* `qemu-system-ppc` (its OpenBIOS already wires the CIF), so Phase 0/1
  need no OpenBIOS compile at all — only a cross-gcc. The `Containerfile` stays
  lean until Phase 3 needs toke/xsltproc.
- **Provenance = cite-don't-mirror**, plus a small **vendored** clib seed
  (`utils/ofclient`, GPLv2, pinned to commit `e5ac46d`) that we *extend* — see
  [`clib/README.md`](clib/README.md). Joins `close-to-the-metal`, NOT
  `provenance-vendored`.
- **New state dir** `~/openbios-clients-lab/` (client binaries, ISOs, logs).

## Verification

Phase 1: `smoke-client.sh ppc` PASSes on this host (KVM/TCG); MANUAL_TESTING
carries the real transcript. Both catalogs green (`paths.py --check`,
`link_check.py`). Committed only when asked.
