# ── the ONE EXIT trap, and the only place cleanup belongs ────────────────────────────
#
# Belt-and-suspenders (CLAUDE.md): if a test dies early — `set -e` tripping, or a `die`
# inside lab-docker.sh slipping past the assertions — this prints a FAIL verdict, so the
# terminal is never left blank with a bare non-zero rc.
#
# CLEANUP GOES THROUGH THIS TRAP, NEVER A SECOND `trap … EXIT`. Bash keeps ONE EXIT trap
# per shell, so a test writing its own silently REPLACES this net — measured across the
# repo on 2026-08-06, when 15 of 16 of these tests had no net at all. Register instead:
#
#     on_exit 'rm -rf "$tmp"'     # evaluated at exit, so it may name a later variable
#
# `tests/test-harness-net.sh` proves the net fires and refuses a test that installs an
# EXIT trap of its own.
